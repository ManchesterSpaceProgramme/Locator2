This is the repository for the LoRaTracker Locator2 board build and programs. 

The LoRaTracker series of boards use Semtechs LoRa devices for long distance tracking and locating.

The Locator reads a GPS and sends the Locators co-ordinates via LoRa to be picked up by a remote receiver.

Build instructions for the Locator2 are in the \Build folder.

Advanced configuration using the settings file is described in the file;

Configuring the LoRaTracker Locator2 Program.doc 

Which is in the \Programs folder
