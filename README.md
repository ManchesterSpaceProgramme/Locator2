This is the repository for the LoRaTracker Locator2 board build and programs. 

Build instructions for the Locator2 are in the \Build folder.

The LoRaTracker series of boards use Semtechs LoRa devices for long distance tracking and locating.

The Locator reads a GPS and sends the Locators co-ordinates via LoRa to be picked up by a remote receiver.
